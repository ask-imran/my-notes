# K8s


## scrambles

-  leverage one of kubernetes greatest strengths: its ability to efficiently utilize compute resources

- Resource limits (cpu and memory, storage too?) are what you tell kubernetes two crtical things about your workload, 
    1. what resources it requires to run properly 
    - Critical for scheduler to know this so it can choose the right node that is responsible for pod health
    2. maximum resources it is allowed to consume

- Resource limits for each container using the `resources` property
- Specifies both `limits` and `requests`
```
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 50m
    memory: 50Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 100Mi
```
- cpu unit is in time and memory is in bytes (memory is easy, simpler than cpu)
    - 1 CPU unit = 1 Physical CPU core or 1 Virtual core
- unit `Mi` stands for mebibytes, there are other units in which [memory can be expressed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-memory)
- The above states that,
    - that in normal operations, the container needs 5% of cpu time and maximum is 10%
    - container needs `50Mi` and can use at most `100Mi`
- request are important during the schedule time and limits are important during run time
- Limits on container = sum (limits of all pods in the container)
- When you set `limit` but not `request`,K8s defaults the request to the limit

//todo check
Exceeding a memory limit makes your container process a candidate for oom-killing, whereas your process basically canâ€™t exceed the set cpu quota, and will never get evicted for trying to use more cpu time than allocated. The system enforces the quota at the scheduler so the process just gets throttled at the limit.

### Linux CGroups and Process model

Cgroups are kernel features, a collection of process
allows you to allocated resources (CPU time, memory, n/w etc) for user-defined tasks (processes) running on a system

All processes on a linux system are child processes of a common parent `init` which is executed by the kernel at boot time and starts other processess which in turn start child processess of their own

Because all process descend from a single parent, the linux process model is a single hierarchy or tree.

Aslo every linux process except `init` inherits certain attributes of its parent proceess

The Cgroup model is similar in that way,
 1. They are hierarchical
 2. Child cgroups inherit certain attributes from their parent cgroup

 The fundamental difference is that many different hierarchies of cgroups can exist simultanesouly on a system.
